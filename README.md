This software is a [DataLad](http://datalad.org) extension that equips DataLad
with alternative and additional core commands that are leaner and written
specifically with enhanced cross-platform compatibility and speed in mind.
Please see the [extension documentation](http://docs.datalad.org/projects/revolution) for
a description on additional commands and functionality.

**Note:** There is *no support* for [git-annex direct mode
repositories](https://git-annex.branchable.com/direct_mode). Users that
previously relied on this mode, and Windows users in particular, are
recommended to use [git-annex V7
mode](https://git-annex.branchable.com/upgrades). DataLad can be instructed to
always use this mode by running:

    git config --global --add datalad.repo.version 6

Command(s) currently provided by this extension

- `rev-diff` -- sibling of `rev-status` for any state comparison, now also on Windows

## Installation

Before you install this package, please make sure that you [install a recent
version of git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/install).  Afterwards,
install the latest version of `datalad-revolution` from
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/datalad-revolution). It is recommended to use
a dedicated [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io):

    # create and enter a new virtual environment (optional)
    virtualenv --system-site-packages --python=python3 ~/env/datalad
    . ~/env/datalad/bin/activate

    # install from PyPi
    pip install datalad_revolution


## Support

If you have a problem or would like to ask a question about how to use DataLad,
please [submit a question to
NeuroStars.org](https://neurostars.org/tags/datalad) with a ``datalad`` tag.
NeuroStars.org is a platform similar to StackOverflow but dedicated to
neuroinformatics.
